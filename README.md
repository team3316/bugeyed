# Preparing for installation

 1. Download [OpenCV for Android](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-android/) (version 3.4.1).
 2. Extract the downloaded zip file. In the extracted folder, there will be two subdirectories - `sdk/native/jni/include` and `sdk/native/libs`. Save
 their full paths to the environment variables `OPENCV_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR` and `OPENCV_JNI_SDK_DIR`, respectively.
 3. The build process should now work!
